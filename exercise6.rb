# We're going to make a shopping list by storing a few items in an
# array. Feel free to start with whatever items you like:

# grocery_list = ["carrots", "toilet paper", "apples", "salmon"]

grocery_list = ["carrots", "toilet paper", "apples", "salmon"]

# After each step, run your program to ensure it works before you move
# onto the next one. It's a good idea to commit often, too.


#     Your next step should present your grocery list with an item on
#     each line, with an asterisk (*) in front of it so that it
#     appears like this:

#     You realize you've forgotten some rice, add it to your list and
#     output it again. Given that you've already output your list
#     twice, it might be good to consider writing a method to do
#     this. Putting common bits of code in a method lets you reuse it
#     throughout your program.

#     You lost count of how many things you need to pick up. Better
#     output the total number of items on your list.

#     Check to see if your list includes "bananas". If it does, output
#     "You need to pick up bananas". Otherwise, output "You don't need
#     to pick up bananas today".

#     Display the second item in the list. (Don't forget that arrays
#     are zero-indexed!)

#     It turns out that everything in this grocery store you're
#     visiting is stored alphabetically, so to better plan out what
#     you need to buy, you should sort your grocery list and output it
#     with asterisks again.

#     After looking everywhere, you can't find the salmon. Delete it
#     from your list and redisplay it.

# After you're done, be sure you have everything committed and pushed
# to your github repo.
